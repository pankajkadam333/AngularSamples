# AngularSamples

It is just a practice project for myself. I am testing few things.

## Tech stack

- Angular 16
- Ngrx component store and behavior subject for state management.
- Json server, .net core apis, typicodes apis for backend.

## Sections

- Home : nothing
- Books : `Crud + filtering+ Pagination` with `ngrx component store` and .net core apis. Github repo for apis: https://github.com/rd003/BookHundred
- Person: Crud with `behavior subject`. Using json server as a backend. To start the server, type `npm run server`.
- User: Displaying users and post. Not need to run server, using typicode's api here. Key point: using `resolver` here.
- Greeting: Simple demo for `template outlet context `
- Tables: More complex demo for `template outlet context`
